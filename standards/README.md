# Standards

This directory contains the official standards and operational protocols defined by the SACF framework.

These standards govern key aspects of human-AI collaboration, including:
- Communication protocols
- Memory structure and management
- Feedback and evaluation cycles
- Security, privacy, and ethical compliance

Each standard is designed to ensure transparency, consistency, and high-quality interactions between human and AI agents.

Updates to standards will be version-controlled and documented carefully in this section.
