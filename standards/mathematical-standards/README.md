# ðŸ“š Mathematical Standards

This directory defines templates and examples for creating structured,
 consistent, and professional mathematical content for AI interaction and documentation.

The goal is to ensure that all mathematical problems, models, analyses, 
and proofs are presented clearly, logically, and in a machine-friendly format.
