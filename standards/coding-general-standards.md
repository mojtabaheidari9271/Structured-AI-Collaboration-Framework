# General Coding Standards for SACF

## Introduction

The **General Coding Standards** for the Structured AI Collaboration Framework (SACF) are established to provide a clear, consistent, and secure foundation for all code contributions, regardless of the programming language or execution environment.

These standards are universal and **language-agnostic**, ensuring that any executable script or program developed under SACF maintains:
- Clarity
- Consistency
- Maintainability
- Security
- Scalability

This document forms the baseline for all future specialized standards and adaptations.

---

## Core Principles

- **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Prioritize readability and simplicity over complexity.
- **Consistency:** Follow unified patterns for structure, naming, and documentation.
- **Documentation:** Document all important functions, modules, and workflows clearly.
- **Security and Privacy:** Protect user data and system integrity at all times.
- **Modularity:** Create reusable and easily testable code components.
- **Version Control Discipline:** Use small, atomic commits with descriptive messages.

---

## File and Directory Organization

- Group files logically by feature or functionality.
- Use clear, descriptive folder and file names.
- Prefer lowercase letters with hyphens (`-`) for naming files and folders.

Example:
```plaintext
/memory-manager/
/memory-manager/session-handler.md
```

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Variables:** Clear and descriptive.
- **Functions:** Action-oriented names.
- **Constants:** Uppercase letters separated by underscores.
- **Classes (if applicable):** PascalCase.
- **Files and Folders:** Lowercase with hyphens.

Maintain consistent naming throughout all projects.

---

## Code Formatting

- **Indentation:** Consistent indentation (preferably 4 spaces, no tabs).
- **Line Length:** Max 100 characters per line where practical.
- **Whitespace:**
  - Use blank lines to separate logical code blocks.
  - Remove trailing whitespace.
- **Braces and Blocks:** Always use braces `{}` for control structures.
- **Comments:**
  - Clear, meaningful, and up-to-date.
  - Avoid redundant or outdated comments.

---

## Documentation Standards

Each script/module should begin with a header comment or docstring stating:
- Purpose
- Inputs and Outputs
- Important Side Effects (if any)

Adapt the format according to the chosen language or environment.

---

## Error Handling

- Never allow silent failures.
- Provide clear and actionable error messages.
- Handle predictable error conditions explicitly.

---

## Security and Privacy Practices

- Never hard-code sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords).
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Apply least privilege principles for all operations.
- Handle and store sensitive data in compliance with SACF's privacy standards.

---

## Testing and Validation

- Develop modular and easily testable components.
- Test critical functionalities thoroughly.
- Plan for future integration with automated test frameworks.

---

## Version Control and Commits

- Commit small, logical changes regularly.
- Use a consistent format for commit messages:

Example:
```plaintext
[Component] Brief, clear description of the change

Examples:
[SessionHandler] Fix memory leak issue
[Templates] Add structured feedback form template
[Docs] Update general coding standards guidelines
```

- Avoid committing generated or irrelevant files.

---

## Best Practices

- Use appropriate linters and formatters to enforce style consistency.
- Conduct regular code reviews focusing on readability and maintainability.
- Prefer simple logic structures unless optimization is critical.

---

## Final Notes

By adhering to these general standards, SACF ensures that all contributions are:
- Readable and accessible to all contributors
- Maintainable and extendable over time
- Secure against common vulnerabilities
- Adaptable to future technology evolutions

Maintaining high code quality is a shared responsibility across the SACF community.
