# Word List and Terminology Guide

This document defines the preferred vocabulary, terminology, and usage rules for technical writing within our project. Consistent word choice ensures clarity, professionalism, and strengthens the bridge between humans and artificial intelligence.

Follow this word list whenever creating documentation, code comments, UI text, or internal communication.

> **Note:** When in doubt, prefer clear, common, and domain-relevant language.

# General Principles for Word Usage

- **Consistency:** Always use the same terminology across the entire project.
- **Precision:** Choose words that accurately describe the concept without ambiguity.
- **Simplicity:** Prefer simpler, more universally understood terms over complex jargon.
- **Localization Awareness:** Avoid phrases that are hard to translate or are culturally specific unless necessary.

---

# Common Cases

- **Acronyms:** Spell out on first use, then use the acronym.
  - Example: Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- **Hyphenation:** Use hyphens to clarify meaning when needed.
  - Correct: real-time system
  - Incorrect: realtime system

- **Technical Terms:** If a term has multiple industry-accepted forms, choose the one most appropriate to the context and be consistent.
