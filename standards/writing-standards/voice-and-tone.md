# What is Voice and Tone?

- **Voice** is the overall personality of our writing. It remains consistent across all content.
- **Tone** is the emotional inflection applied to the voice, varying depending on the context, audience, and purpose.

Think of **voice** as "who we are" and **tone** as "how we speak" in different situations.

# Our Voice: Professional, Clear, Supportive

Our writing voice must be:

- **Professional but Approachable**  
  Write formally but not stiffly. Sound like an expert who is happy to guide.

- **Clear and Precise**  
  Avoid ambiguity, jargon, and complex constructions. Use plain language.

- **Supportive and Educational**  
  Assume your reader wants to learn. Be encouraging, not condescending.

- **Neutral and Unbiased**  
  Avoid emotionally charged language, personal opinions, or cultural bias.

# Our Tone: Adaptive and Context-Aware

While our voice is constant, our tone adapts depending on the situation:

| Situation                          | Tone Characteristics                       | Example                                              |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Installation Guides                | Encouraging, Reassuring                    | "Let's walk through the installation process."       |
| Error Messages                     | Clear, Non-blaming                         | "The connection failed. Please check your settings." |
| Technical Explanations             | Detailed, Patient                         | "This module processes input data in real-time."     |
| Warnings and Alerts                | Serious, Direct                           | "Warning: Disconnect all power sources before proceeding." |
| Success Messages                   | Positive, Concise                         | "Configuration complete. You are ready to proceed!"   |

# Key Tone Tips

- **Use active voice:**
  - Correct: "Run the configuration tool."
  - Incorrect: "The configuration tool should be run."

- **Avoid slang and idioms:**
  - Correct: "Begin the update process."
  - Incorrect: "Kick off the update."

- **Prefer instructions over descriptions:**
  - Instead of explaining why something might fail, guide the user on what to do.

- **Stay calm during errors:**
  - Never blame the user. Offer clear next steps.
