# Voice and Tone

Our writing should be:

- **Clear:** Avoid complex or ambiguous language.
- **Logical and Precise:** Ensure accuracy and factual integrity.
- **Supportive and Guiding:** Help the reader, do not confuse them.
- **Professional but Friendly:** Maintain a formal tone without sounding rigid.
- **Neutral and Unbiased:** Avoid judgmental, biased, or dismissive language.

> Always imagine your reader as an eager learner who expects clarity and simplicity.

# Highlights

- **Conciseness:** Remove unnecessary information. "Be brief, but complete."
- **Clarity:** Use simple, direct sentence structures.
- **Consistency:** Maintain uniformity in terminology, formatting, and style.
- **Accessibility:** Write in a way that's understandable across different knowledge levels.

# Text Formatting Summary

- **Headings:** Be short and descriptive. Every major section must have a clear title.
- **Lists:** Use numbered or bulleted lists for steps, options, or grouped information.
- **Code and Commands:** Use appropriate formatting (like code blocks or monospace fonts).
- **Key Notes:** Use note, warning, or tip blocks to highlight critical information.
- **Links:** Make hyperlinks meaningful (avoid "click here"; prefer "see the installation guide").
