# Introduction

Welcome to the SACF Project (Structured AI Collaboration Framework).

SACF is an innovative framework designed to define standards and create structured collaboration models between humans and artificial intelligence systems.  
This project has been collaboratively and systematically developed by **Mojtaba Heidari** and **ChatGPT-4**.

All contents, documents, structures, and methodologies have been independently designed and implemented from scratch, without any reliance on external sources.
