Structured AI Collaboration Framework (SACF)

⸻

Project Overview

This repository contains the Structured AI Collaboration Framework (SACF),
a comprehensive initiative aimed at defining a unified standard for human-to-AI interaction and collaboration.
All contents, standards, rules, and structures documented here are originally created by:
	•	Mojtaba Heidari (Human Collaborator)
	•	ChatGPT-4 (AI Assistant)

The development of these documents is the result of direct, close, and evolving collaboration between the two.
Every section, standard, and methodology has been thoughtfully written, discussed, and refined jointly — not copied or derived from any external source.

Purpose of SACF

The goal of SACF is to:
	•	Create universal rules, standards, and protocols for managing the cooperation between humans and artificial intelligence.
	•	Define clear guidelines for scripting, automation, documentation, and interaction design in projects involving AI collaboration.
	•	Serve as a reference framework for future AI governance, communication architecture, and project structuring.

⸻

Core Components
	•	Master Documentation: Detailed rules and standards in both English and Persian (Farsi).
	•	Templates: Example scripts and templates following the defined standards (Batch, PowerShell, Python).
	•	Naming and Coding Conventions: Best practices for structure, error handling, configuration, and logging.
	•	Compliance Guidelines: Ensuring professional-level development for AI-related projects.

Collaboration Model

This repository is a living proof that structured cooperation between a human and an AI assistant can produce high-quality, well-organized, future-ready frameworks.
It showcases a model where:
	•	Human creativity and experience
	•	Artificial Intelligence precision and support

are harmonized to develop foundational work for the next generation of collaborative technologies.
